/* 
  Creative Coding: Dear Data - Arthur Casarin
  The data I recorded is of many aspects of matches of the game:
  "Plants vs. Zombiesâ„¢ Garden Warfare 2"
  where I played and recorded one match a day. This version of the program currently uses
  7 days of that data, but the code is written to be suited for more to be added in the future.
  In this code, the term "Vanquish" refer to when a player character in the game is 
  defeated temporarily.

String[] fullData;
// Will contain the same data as above, but with every cell split in order
// to manipulate the individual data items

int posX;
